[h1]What Is This?[/h1]

This mod makes Expansion airdrop containers float if they land in deep water, instead of sinking to Davy Jones's locker.

Players can swim out to them and climb on them, or use boats to get the loot inside.

Once emptied of loot, they will sink.

[h1]Installation Instructions:[/h1]

Install this mod like any other mod - copy it into your server folder and add it to your mods list. Make sure to copy the .bikey into your server keys if you're not using a server management tool like OmegaManager which does that automatically.

This mod only needs to be run on the server but can run on the client just fine if you repack it.

[h1]Repack & Source Code:[/h1]

You can repack this mod if you like, and do anything else you want with it for that matter. Just keep in mind my future updates won't be applied so make sure to check back for new versions if you notice any bugs. The source code is on my GitHub at www.zenarchist.com

[h1]Buy Me A Coffee:[/h1]

All my mods are free and open source, but it takes an enormous amount of time to put some of these mods together. If I've helped you out, please consider helping me buy my next coffee! I don't expect it, but I very much appreciate it.
